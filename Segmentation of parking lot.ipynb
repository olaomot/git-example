For different neighbourhoods, the activities at different venues in each neighbourhood has an effect on the average time taken for car owners to find parking space in such neighbourhoods. For example for neighbourhoods with many restaurants, night clubs and cafe, the average time taken to find parking space could be much longer in the evenings when compared to the average time taken to find parking space in neighbourhoods that do not have such points of interest.\n"

Drivers are not the only ones impacted by this problem \u2014 cities are as well. Out of 6,000 U.S. drivers that responded to a survey, sixty three percent reported they avoided driving to a destination due to parking challenges. This can consequently impact local businesses and economic activity.\n[3] As large metropolitan cities continue to grow year-over-year, traffic congestion continues to rise with no sign of slowing down."
